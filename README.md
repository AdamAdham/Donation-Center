# Donation Center


### Overview
The platform is designed to streamline the process of connecting organizations in need of donations with individuals and entities willing to contribute. It serves three main types of users: Admins, Organization Representatives, and Donors. Each user type has specific roles and functionalities tailored to their needs.

### Admins
Admins have comprehensive control over the platform, including user management, submission reviews, and request approvals. They can view and manage lists of registered organizations and donors, review submissions for credibility, and handle requests to join or participate in the platform. Admins also have the authority to delete user accounts and manage password settings to ensure the security and integrity of the platform.

### Organization Representatives
Organizations use the platform to register, post donation requests, and manage their donation activities. Representatives can submit detailed posts about needed items, receive notifications when their posts are chosen by donors, and track the fulfillment of these posts. They also have the capability to delete or update donation posts and view details of the donors who have contributed to their requests.

### Donors
Donors use the platform to view and select donation requests from various organizations. They can register, specify their roles (e.g., regular donor, teacher, or doctor), and upload necessary verification documents. Donors can choose items to donate, schedule pickups or drop-offs, and track the arrival of drivers for their donations. The platform also allows donors to view and filter donation requests by category, ensuring they can contribute to causes that align with their interests and availability.

Overall, the platform facilitates a structured and efficient way to manage donations and volunteer efforts, ensuring that organizations receive the support they need and donors can effectively contribute to meaningful causes. It combines user-friendly interfaces with robust backend systems to maintain a seamless experience for all participants.
